 A Message Posting

 An app for chatting with friends

 But only with haiku

### By: Starlynne Start

### This will be a message posting app, where you can talk deep philosophy or shallow imaginings, discuss your day or your life, BUT ONLY IN HAIKU.

### MVP
* _An app where you can post messages, validated to be haiku format_
  * _line by line, it must be 5 syllables, 7 syllables, 5 syllables._
* _Original posts must be validated as haiku._
* _Following comments or discussion may be in non haiku format, but will be limitted by length._
* _Users can view all without log-in, but must sign in to post or comment_
* _Database backed and deployed live_
* _Include admin dashboard for oversight CRUD capabilities_


### Tools

_I intend to build this using Ruby/Rails, backed by psql, and deploy on Heroku._

_I will use the Words api, as it has syllable count available https://www.wordsapi.com/_

_I plan to style using scss and bootstrap_


### Stretch Goals

* _I would like to include the ability to like or follow a particular poet_
* _I would like to build out a section of the site dedicated to actual haiku history, and Basho_
* _I would like to use various Auth so users can connect with their existing media accounts_
* _I would like to build out the app so it has areas or subcategories of focus_
* _I would like to animate my pigeon logo_
* _I would like to have a cool ninja pigeon welcome screen/animation while everything loads._
* _I would like to include a few custom emoji 'likes' or 'splats'_


#### To meet the stretch goals, I would need:

* _A way to animate, and a tool to do so. Pehaps imbed a Unity element?_

* _Time_

#### As Loren reviews
#### So the day turns to nighttime
#### Please approve my dream
